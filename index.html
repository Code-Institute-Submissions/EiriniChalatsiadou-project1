                the

                The word acropolis is from the Greek words ἄκρον and πόλις.

        <div class="general information float-center"> Ancient Greece was a northeastern Mediterranean
            civilization, existing from the Greek Dark Ages of the 12th-9th centuries BC
            to the end of classical antiquity, that comprised a loose collection of culturally and linguistically
            related city-states and other territories. Most of these regions were officially unified only once, for 13 years, 
            under Alexander the Great's empire from 336 to 323 BC (though this excludes a number of Greek city-states free from Alexander's jurisdiction 
            in the western Mediterranean, around the Black Sea, Cyprus, and Cyrenaica). In Western history, the era of classical antiquity
             was immediately followed by the Early Middle Ages and the Byzantine period.

        The Acropolis Museum (Greek: Μουσείο Ακρόπολης, Mouseio
        Akropolis) is an archaeological museum focused on the findings of the archaeological site
        of the Acropolis of Athens. The museum was built to house every artifact found on the rock and on the
        surrounding slopes, from the Greek Bronze Age to Roman and Byzantine Greece. It also lies over the ruins of part
        of Roman and early Byzantine Athens.
        The museum was founded in 2003 while the Organization of the Museum was established in 2008. It opened to the
        public on 20 June 2009. More than 4,250 objects are exhibited over an area of 14,000 square metres.

    <div id="panathenaic-stadium-info" class="float-left"> A stadium was built on the site of a simple racecourse by
        the Athenian statesman Lykourgos (Lycurgus) c. 330 BC, primarily for the Panathenaic Games. It was rebuilt in
        marble by Herodes Atticus,
        an Athenian Roman senator, by 144 AD it had a capacity of 50,000 seats. After the rise of Christianity in the
        4th century it was largely abandoned. The stadium was excavated in 1869 and hosted the Zappas Olympics in 1870
        and 1875. After being refurbished, it hosted the opening
        and closing ceremonies of the first modern Olympics in 1896 and was the venue for 4 of the 9 contested sports.
        It was used for various purposes in the 20th century and was once again used as an Olympic venue in 2004. It is
        the finishing point for the annual Athens Classic Marathon.
        It is also the last venue in Greece from where the Olympic flame handover ceremony to the host nation takes
        place.
